     * Stage multiple new, changed, or removed files and folders in the repository directory.
     *
     * Instead of giving concrete paths to the files / objects to be added the function
     * takes a shell like glob/wildcard:
     * - \c * matches any number of any characters including none
     * - \c ? matches any single character
     * - \c [abc] matches one character given in the bracket (\c abc is example)
     * - \c [a-z] matches one character in the range of characters (\c a-z is example)
     * - \c \\* matches a star
     * - \c \\? matches a question mark
     * - \c \\\\ matches a backslash
     * - \c \\[ matches an opening square bracket
     *
     * The matching happens - unlike usual shells - on the whole pathname (inside the repository).
     * So `*` matches all files (including all subdirectories).
     *
     * Note: In fact you can never add a folder, you add files in a folder; i.e. it is
     * impossible to add an empty folder. Git just knows files, not folders as items.
     * If a file is in a folder the folder exists; if there is nothing in the folder the
     * folder is ignored. (File means also links etc.)
     *
     * Note: To write \c \? into a C++ string you probably need \c "\\?" etc.
     *
     * Note: Globs do not match hidden files in the form of Unix dotfiles; to match them the pattern
     * must explicitly start with \c . For example, \c * matches all visible files
     * while \c .* matches all hidden files.
